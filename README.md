Goal: Playing the rock-paper-scissors game against the computer. <br />
Solution: Incorporates a built-in Python library to allow random play by the computer and a simple if-else logic to determine the winner. <br />

Game rules:
  Hand winnig combinations:
  
  ^..^ Rock > Scissors <br />
  ^..^ Scissors > Paper <br />
  ^..^ Paper > Rock <br />
  ^..^ When both hands are the same, it's a Draw! <br />
  
   
   Game winning rule:<br />
 If you win 5 hands agains the computer, you win! If the computer wins 5 hands against you, you lose!
